from math import *
number = float(input(“Enter a decimal number”))
roundup = ceil(number)
print(roundup)
</pre>When using the ceil function you must import the math library, the first line of code at the top does this.
This program takes a decimal input from the user, then uses ceil to round it up to the next whole number and then prints it. E.g. if the user entered 5.345 it would print 6.
